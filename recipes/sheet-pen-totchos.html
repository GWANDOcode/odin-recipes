      <h3>Directions</h3>
      <div>
        <h5>Step 1</h5>
        <p>Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
          Arrange potato nuggets in a single layer on a large baking sheet.</p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h5>Step 2</h5>
        <p>Bake in the preheated oven, tossing often, until golden brown
          and crisp, about 35 minutes. Remove from oven; sprinkle Mexican
          cheese on top. Continue baking until cheese is melted,
          about 10 minutes more.</p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h5>Step 3</h5>
        <p>Drizzle sausage gravy over potato nuggets and cheese.
          Scatter avocado, andouille sausage, green onions, and
          jalapeno peppers on top.</p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h5>Step 4</h5>
        <p>Gradually whisk 2 1/2 cups milk into the flour mixture,
          and bring to a simmer. Stir in shredded Cheddar and finely
          grated Parmesan cheeses; season with salt and pepper.
          Cook and stir over low heat until cheese is melted and
          sauce has thickened, 3 to 5 minutes, adding up to 1/2 cup
          more milk if needed. Pour cheese sauce over macaroni and stir
          until well combined.</p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h5>Step 5</h5>
        <p>Grease a large skillet with butter.
          Crack in 3 eggs; cook until egg whites are firm and
          starting to brown on the bottom, about 5 minutes. 
          Transfer to a large plate using a wide spatula. Repeat with
          remaining eggs. Arrange fried eggs over potato nuggets.</p>
