        <h2>There are a few impostors out there that claim to be Long
          Island Iced Teas. In actuality, there is only one correct way
          to make a LIIT... and this is it!</h2>
        <p>One thing must be cleared up about the Long Island Iced
          Tea straight away: It is living a lie. For starters, it's
          not entirely clear that it's actually from Long Island. That's
          debatable. But, folks, it is most assuredly not tea. You will not
          find a drop of tea in this cocktail. But don't hold that
          against it. Read on to learn how to make this 5-star recipe
          for Long Island Iced Tea.</p>

        <h2>What's In a Long Island Iced Tea?</h2>
        <p>Some people have asked, does the Long Island
          iced tea have alcohol in it? Boy does it ever!</p>
        <p>The Long Island iced tea is the liquor-cabinet equivalent
           of what the kids once called a "suicide soda"
           (a big ol' splash of every drink from the soda fountain
           into one enormous ice-filled cup). On the face of it,
           the Long Island Iced tea doesn't seem tenable: Vodka, rum,
           gin, tequila, triple sec — all mingling in the same cocktail
           glass, tempered only by a dash of sweet and sour mix and a
           splash of cola. Sounds like trouble. And obviously it can be.</p>
        <p>But it's undisputable, this cocktail proves itself an unlikely
           success, and a prime example of when the whole is greater
           than the sum of its parts. Tossing all of these strong spirits
           together somehow softens the edges off of each individual
           spirit. It's a marvel of science, frankly. Somehow this
           cocktail, seemingly of odds and ends from the liquor cabinet,
           manages the impossible: it actually tastes good. Very good. So be
           careful out there, folks.</p>
